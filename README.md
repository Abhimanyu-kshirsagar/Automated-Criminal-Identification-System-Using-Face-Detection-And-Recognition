# Automated-Criminal-Identification-System-Using-Face-Detection-And-Recognition
The sole motive behind this technology is to make criminal identification easier, and this project is a step toward achieving that goal by designing a system that identifies a face and displays its details, using C++, OpenCV, and the Haar Cascade algorithm.
# Automated Criminal Identification System Using Face Detection & Recognition

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to assist law enforcement agencies in quickly identifying criminals by using facial recognition technology.  
The system detects a personâ€™s face, matches it against a database, and displays their details instantly.  

**Tech Stack:**  
- C++  
- OpenCV  
- Haar Cascade Algorithm  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades.
- Face recognition with trained models.
- Automatic retrieval of criminal profiles from the database.
- Support for both static images and live camera feed.
